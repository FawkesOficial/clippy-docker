### üáµüáπ [Portuguese version here / Clica aqui para ler a descri√ß√£o em Portugu√™s](README-pt.md) üáµüáπ

Clippy is a simple web scraper and downloader for NOVA School of Science and Technology's internal e-learning platform, CLIP.

The program scrapes a user's courses for available downloads and syncs them with a local folder.

CLIP's files are organized in subcategories for each academic course like this:
Academic year >> Course documents >> Document subcategory >> Files list

Clippy successfully navigates the site in order to scrape it, and compares it to a local folder with a similar structure, keeping it in sync with the server.

Please note that the program is only available in Portuguese while it's still in BETA.

## Functionalities
- Extremely fast thanks to its asynchronous execution (allows checking up to 8 courses simultaneously).
- Transfer multiple files (up to 4 files simultaneously).
- Automatic file synchronization between CLIP and the user's folder.
- Support for choosing the academic year you want to download.
- Completely private, free, and open-source.
